## My AI Arch

## A brief of this distribution
This distribution uses a modificated version of Arch Linux's Archinstaller, and other utilities, making Arch's usage and installation an easier process for beginners and daily users.

## A NOTICE THAT THIS DISTRO IS AT THE VERY BETA VERSION AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AS THE CODE IS NOT STABLE!
